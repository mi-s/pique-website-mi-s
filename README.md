This is a static landing page that I built from scratch for Pique, a mobile app startup. 

My main goals were to:

1. Convey what Pique is (a mobile app)
      - Did this by adding an image carousel wrapped in the silhouette of an iPhone
2. Make the page function properly across all devices
      - Accomplished using flexboxes and media queries
3. Allow viewers to easily subscribe to Pique's mailing list to learn more.

I also built a navigation bar which is a bar on larger devices but shrinks to a menu button on smaller devices.  However, this is not a part of the live site because I was not given any content to fill the appropriate sections.
