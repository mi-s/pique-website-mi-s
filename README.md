[Official Website](https://getpique.app)

This is a static landing page that I built from scratch for Pique, a mobile app startup. 

My main goals were to:

1. Convey what Pique is (a mobile app)
      - Did this by adding an image carousel wrapped in the silhouette of an iPhone
      - Unfortunately, I was not given any other material to put on the site, as the app is still very early in development
2. Make the page function properly across all devices
      - Accomplished using flexboxes and media queries
3. Allow viewers to easily subscribe to Pique's mailing list to learn more.
